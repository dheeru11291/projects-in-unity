🐦 Flarpy Bird — A Classic Reimagined in Unity
Welcome to Flarpy Bird, a playful clone of the iconic Flappy Bird game, rebuilt from scratch using Unity. This project is part of my ongoing journey in game development, blending nostalgic gameplay with clean design and modular code structure.

🎮 Gameplay Overview
Tap or click to flap your wings and navigate the bird through a series of pipes.

Simple controls, but deceptively challenging mechanics.

Score increases with each pipe successfully passed.

Game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground.

🛠️ Features
Smooth physics using Unity’s Rigidbody2D and Collider systems.

Pixel-perfect collision detection for accurate gameplay.

Modular scripts for bird movement, pipe spawning, and scoring.

Custom sprites and animations for a polished visual experience.

Responsive UI with score tracking and restart functionality.

💡 Why This Project Matters
As a third-year B.Tech student passionate about game development, this project reflects my hands-on learning approach. It’s not just a clone—it’s a sandbox for experimenting with mechanics, design, and player engagement. Whether you're a fellow learner or a curious player, I hope Flarpy Bird brings you a smile and a challenge.
